## SCL OCaml

This is a (work in progress) implementation of the [SCL calculus](https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.05954). 

### How to execute

It currently does not work very well, but it can be ran using the `dune exec` command. Make sure to have dune installed, and use the `opam install . --deps-only` command to install the dependencies of the project.
